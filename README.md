# ComfyUI Frontend Vue Basic

A demonstration custom node that showcases how to integrate Vue as a frontend framework within ComfyUI, complete with PrimeVue components and vue-i18n support.

> **Note**: Since ComfyUI Frontend **1.33.9**, Vue is no longer exposed by the frontend. This project now uses a standalone Vue instance bundled with the extension instead of relying on the frontend's Vue.

## Overview

ComfyUI Frontend Vue Basic provides a working example of how to build interactive UI components for ComfyUI custom nodes using modern web technologies. It features a basic drawing board inside a custom node that outputs the created image as a result.

## Technologies

- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** - Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces
- **[PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/)** - Rich UI component library for Vue
- **[vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/)** - Internationalization plugin for Vue.js

## Features

- Interactive drawing board within a custom node
- Modern UI components with PrimeVue
- Multi-language support via vue-i18n
- Integration with ComfyUI's API system

## Installation

⚠️ **Important** ⚠️

This demonstration node is not designed to be installed directly via **git clone**. For proper functionality, please install through:

- [ComfyUI Manager]()
- [ComfyUI Registry]()

## Development Setup
If you want to learn how to develop this custom node or modify it, you can set up a local development environment. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository in your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smk-h/ComfyUI_sm_utils
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI_sm_utils
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
5. Refresh ComfyUI to load.

## Usage

After installation:

1. Add the "vue-basic" node under examples to your workflow
2. Use the drawing interface to create your image
3. Connect the output to compatible nodes (Preview Image, for example) that accept image inputs
4. Run your workflow to process the drawn image

## Development

For those interested in understanding how Vue can be integrated into ComfyUI custom nodes:

1. Review the code structure to see how Vue components are mounted
2. Examine the ComfyUI API integration patterns
3. Note how PrimeVue components and i18n are initialized and used
